What does it do?
----------------

The *indieweb* TYPO3 extension aims to provide a (growing) collection of tools and techniques for running (and
publishing to) an `IndieWeb`_-ish TYPO3 website. It tries to make these techniques so easy to configure and
use that there's simply no excuse for not employing them on your site. Right now the extension enables you to

- receive `Webmentions`_.

Additional features will be added over time.
